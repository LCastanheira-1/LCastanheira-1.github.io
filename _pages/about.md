I am a second-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, where I have the privilege of being advised by Theo Benson. My broad research direction has been applications observability (e.g., distributed tracing) since undergrad when I met Theo. Currently, we are investigating potential avenues for further leveraging eBPF for observability (beyond the pioneering work that's already been done by Brendan Gregg and the folks at BCC). I gave a talk about the initial steps of this work at the [Linux Plumbers Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDNZY0HQOMw&t=7174s).

I have a MSc and BSc in Computer Science from UFRGS (Brazil). My full list of publications can be found on [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/245/3154.html).
